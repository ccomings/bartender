# Beertendr

[Beertendr][live-link] is a full stack web application inspired by Untapped. The goal of our site is to connect users with breweries, beers, and other users around the world. The app provides functionality to add beers to a brewery, 'checkin' with a beer, and fully navigate between beers, breweries, and checkins. Beertendr utilizes Ruby on Rails for the backend, PostgreSQL database, and React/Redux on the front end.

## Features

### Checkins
No need to navigate to a beer page to checkin. Create a checkin from any screen.

### Breweries and Beers
Seamlessly navigate through breweries, beers, and checkins.


## Future Features

* Editing Profiles
* Likes of Checkins
* Friends/follows
* Interfacing with the BreweryDB.com api for complete and robust database
